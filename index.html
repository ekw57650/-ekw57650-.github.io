        <h2><center>Life Before the NFL</center></h2>
        
        <p>
            Todd Gurley was born in 1994 and attended Tarboro High School in North Carolina. He played football, track and basketball. In his junior season, he rushed for 1,472 yards with 26 touchdowns. Todd was named the Rocky Mount Telegram All-Area Offensive Player of the Year in 2010 and named the North Carolina AP Player of the year in 2011. He played for the University of Georgia from 2012-2014 and soon became the most popular guy to wear the red and black. He even joined the UGA track team in 2013. However, he was suspended for a few games in his last season for receiving over $3,000 for signed autopgraphs and memorabilia. In his first game back after the suspension, he tore his ACl ending his college career. A couple months later he was selected 10th overall by the St. Louis Rams (now in Los Angeles) in the NFL draft. The table below shows his total rushing yards during his time at UGA.

During his rehabilitation, Gurley got the call from the Rams as he was selected 10th overall. He did not play the first few games of the season. On September 27, 2015 he made his debut against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He scored his first NFL touchdown October 25, 2015 against the Browns. His cleats and jersey were inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame after beating the 49ers. He was one of the five rookies selected in the Pro Bowl. He finished his first season with 1,106 yards in 229 attempts with 10 touchdowns. However, this year Gurley has been held to much fewer yards. The bulleted list below is just a few recognitions he has accumulated in his career: 

          
            
          <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
              <li>Pro Bowl 2015</li>
              <li style="color:red"><b><i>NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year 2015</i></b></li>
              <li>Second-team All SEC 2013</li>
              <li>First-team All SEC 2012</li>
            
    
        </ul> 
    

***The second bullet is highlighted in red because I believe this is his biggest accomplishment***

	Due to his amazing recovery story and outbreak in the NFL, Todd Gurley was chosen to be in many commercials and ads for big companies such as Jolly Ranchers and Carl's Jr. In the Jolly Rancher commercial, he can be seen wearing a pink tutu. In the Carl's Jr. commercial he is eating a fake burger. He has become a pivotal figure in promoting the LA Rams. Now that the team is back in LA, I'm sure he will be seen in more ads and one of the faces of California pro teams. I enjoy watching Todd Gurley because his progress since his surgery is phenomenal. Not many players can come back from an ACL injury and still be that good. Below is a video of Gurley in the Jolly Ranchers commercial from YouTube:
